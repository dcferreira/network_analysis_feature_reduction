Feature Reduction for Network Traffic Analysis
==============================================

This repository contains code for experiments using multiple techniques for reducing network traffic features vectors.
The code was used in *(paper under review)*.

The code here contains all that is necessary to run all the experiments in the paper, as well as the proposed
Traffic Flow Mapper prototype.

Running
-------

First run ``get_data.sh`` to download the data.

Then run ``run.py``:

.. code:: bash

    python run.py -h

By asking for help for each method, you'll get a list of the parameters and default values.
For example, for the ``cats_ae`` method:

.. code:: bash

    python cats_ae -h

As an example, running ``cats_ae``, with ``$DATAPATH`` the path where the data is:

.. code:: bash

    python run.py --size 2 --number 5 cats_ae --reconstruct_loss mse --reconstruct_weight $DATAPATH

Using Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use Docker to run this code, without need for downloading the source.
To do that, run:

.. code:: bash

    docker run dcferreira/network_analysis_feature_reduction -h

That command should output the help message.

To run the same example as above, run

.. code:: bash

    docker run dcferreira/network_analysis_feature_reduction --size 2 --number 5 cats_ae --reconstruct_loss mse --reconstruct_weight $DATAPATH


Traffic Flow Mapper
-------------------

This repository contains also a prototype tool for visualizing network traffic flows.
The Traffic Flow Mapper (TFM) presents flows taken from the
`UNSW-NB15 dataset <https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/>`_
in a 2D plot.

Running with Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can easily run the Traffic Flow Mapper prototype with docker:

.. code:: bash

    docker run -p 5006:5006 dcferreira/network_analysis_feature_reduction tfm

To access it, navigate with your browser to http://localhost:5006.
Using Firefox for this is recommended, but other browsers should also work.

Features
~~~~~~~~

The main TFM screen shows the flows as they appear.
To start the stream, press the ``â–º Play`` button.
On top of the plot, you have options to control:

* whether train data is shown in the background
* how fast new flows should appear
* number of flows to keep plotted (increasing this will make TFM slower)
* how to color the flows: default option is to color them by their true class, but you can change it to color by predicted class
* the current flow number (allows fast-forwarding/rewinding)
* the radius used for the Visual Classifier (detailed in the paper)

Below the plot, you see confusion matrices for multiple classifiers.
In these matrices, rows are true classes and columns are predicted classes.
The true classes distinguish between the various attack classes, while these classifiers are only trained to detect Attack/Normal.

When you click some flow, you get new content to the right of the plot.
This includes information about the flow and how it was classified by multiple methods.
